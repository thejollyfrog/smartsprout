      <description>Page loading speed is not just important for improving the user-experience. In fact, page loading time affects visitor retention, sales conversions, and even search rankings. This is how we recommend speeding up your website:
Resize and optimise images If your website is slow, your image file size could be to blame. Before using an image, at the very least it should be resized to match the maximum display dimensions and compressed using image compression tools.</description>

      <description>While image attribution isn&amp;rsquo;t always required, there are instances when the best image for the job requires attribution (by law). This short guide explains where to find blog images, which images need attributing and how to attribute your images correctly.
Which images require attribution? Some websites, such as Unsplash and Pixabay have a sizeable library of images that have been marked as needing no attribution, but there are other sites (such as Flickr and Wikimedia Commons) where some images are offered free of charge in return for attribution.</description>

If you don&amp;rsquo;t know your subject inside out, aim to speak to someone who does. Arrange an interview and prepare a set of questions, leaving time for your expert to school you on some things that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know to ask.</description>

      <description>Should your blog be written in the first person? For brands like Nike and Apple, their products are endorsed by influential people and are promoted at high-profile sporting events and on prime-time television. Thus, many of their customers are arguably using their products as an extension of their own persona/image.
As these brands are designed to make their users feel powerful/elite, a corporate, authoritative voice is most suited here.
When choosing whether to use the first person in your business blog, consider the following questions:</description>

      <description>Your blog is a powerful lead generation tool if you know how to use it. While a blog is never a tool for passive income, it is, potentially, very cost effective in comparison to other tools available, such as paid advertising.
Build a business blog that delivers! Before your blog can generate leads, it needs to meet several criteria:
Posts should be:
 part of a detailed content strategy in line with the needs or desires of your target market significantly better than other content in your niche written accurately (both in their content and grammar)  In addition, you will need to post frequently to keep the interest of your users (this also helps with search engine rankings); but how frequently is frequently?</description>

      <description>Know your customers Before you start blogging, you must know who you are blogging for. Take some time to think about your customer/client base and consider what these people have in common. Ask yourself, what common issues do my customers face and which of these issues can I help to solve?
With their common interest or problem in mind, make a list of questions your customers/clients might ask and categorise them into groups.</description>
