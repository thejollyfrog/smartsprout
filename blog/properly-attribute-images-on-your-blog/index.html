  <p>While image attribution isn&rsquo;t always required, there are instances when the best image for the job requires attribution (by law). This short guide explains where to find blog images, which images need attributing and how to attribute your images correctly.</p>
<h2 id="which-images-require-attribution">Which images require attribution?</h2>
<p>Some websites, such as <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com">Pixabay</a> have a sizeable library of images that have been marked as needing no attribution, but there are other sites (such as <a href="https://flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Commons</a>) where some images are offered free of charge in return for attribution.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-the-different-creative-commons-licenses-mean">What do the different Creative Commons licenses mean?</h2>

<h2 id="how-to-attribute-images-shared-under-a-creative-commons-licence">How to attribute images shared under a Creative Commons licence</h2>
<p>When attributing an image, the best practice is to remember the acronym <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution">TASL</a>, this stands for Title, Author, Source, Licence.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-tasl">What is &ldquo;TASL&rdquo;?</h3>
<h4 id="title--what-is-the-name-of-this-work">Title — What is the name of this work?</h4>
<p>If the author(s) has named their work, use this name. If not, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<h4 id="author--who-owns-the-material">Author — Who owns the material?</h4>
<p>In most circumstances, you should name the author(s) of the material. Sometimes, the author may ask you to give credit to an organisation website or pseudonym — this is their prerogative. In some cases, the licensor may not want to be attributed at all. In all of these cases, follow their instruction.</p>
<h4 id="source--where-can-i-find-it">Source — Where can I find it?</h4>
<p>Where did you source the image? Provide the source of the image so that others can find it, too. Assuming this was found on the internet, provide a link or URL of the image&rsquo;s origin.</p>
<h4 id="licence--how-can-i-use-it">Licence — How can I use it?</h4>
<p>What licence has the author chosen for their creative work? Be sure to state and link to the licence on Creative Commons.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
<figure><img src="rose-in-the-rain-seenbynick-flickr.jpg"/>
</figure>



<figcaption style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129479495@N06/44607783612">"A rose in the rain"</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129479495@N06">seenbynick</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0">&nbsp;CC BY-NC-SA 2.0&nbsp;</a></figcaption>


</p>
<h2 id="images-which-should-not-be-used-on-your-blog">Images which should not be used on your blog</h2>
<p>Unless given explicit permission, avoid using or modifying images that may have full copyright. Copyright is automatic and, therefore, you should assume that works are copyrighted unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this rule, with regards to fair usage, but that is a more complicated subject which I will cover in a future post.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>When using images you find online, always check the licence, assume that the work is copyrighted unless otherwise stated. In some cases, the licensor will be explicit on how they want the image to be attributed. If not, refer to the guidelines of the given licence.</p>
